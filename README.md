# Final-Project
In this project, we were assigned into groups working into a company called Chada Tech that specializes in custom software design and development for both domestic and international clients. My team was assigned to develop an application for SNHU Travel, which is a travel agency seeking to expand their client base with new tools for thoe customers.  

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs, you can start with system analysis. This can be done by asking old users for feedback and covering code changes. You need to identify the specific inputs and outputs of your system.

User stories are a great way to express your users' needs. It is a tool mainly used in agile development. It helps to understand the end user's point of view. It also helps you understand what your users want and create a simple requirements description for it.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Program development can be approached with a variety of project management strategies. The waterfall method is one such strategy. It helps us anticipate needs and adopt specific strategies. Other approaches are iterative, prototypical, agile, and incremental.

Some of the most common and popular Agile processes to include are Crystal, Scrum, Extreme Programming, etc. These approaches and processes offer unique opportunities for testing, planning, and integration efforts.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Good team members follow team standards and project styles during the coding and design process. It is important to maintain a sense of progress within the team. All aspects of project development should be considered. You should also be friendly and responsible.
